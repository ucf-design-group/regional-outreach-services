# Regional Outreach Services

Regional Outreach Services website for Office of Student Involvement during the Summer of 2015. It will showcase all the regional campuses that UCF has to offer:

	1. Valencia West
	2. Valencia Osceola
	3. Daytona Campus
	4. Sanford / Lake Mary
	5. Altamonte
	6. Cocoa
	7. Palm Bay
	8. South Lake
	9. Ocala
	10. Leesburg

Features:

	1. Multisite. All the other sites (Valencia West, Valencia Osceola, etc.) are gathered into one main website, which is the general ROS website.
	2. Interactive map that shows all the location on the main ROS website. 
	3. ROS main site: interactive map, about/contact, calendar events.
	4. Side sites: image cover, about/contact, people involved, calendar events.
	
Concerns:

	1. The visual framework should echo throughout the rest of the site in order to make the creation process streamlined and easier.
	2. How the map will work out and if it will be too intesive.
	3. (Jess) Continue learning best practices for front-end development coding.
